# Fruit-Classification-Project
Exploration into CNN classification using the Keras API and fruit-360 dataset from Kaggle
In this project using the Tensorflow Keras API I create a series of CNN models and evaluate the best one on the Fruit-360 dataset from Kaggle which contains 131 fruits and vegetables to classify.

Ultimately the best model was a transfer learning model based on pretrained weights from ResNet50
